# [DotCot by VentureCat](https://peaceful-woodland-39661.herokuapp.com/welcome) 

**DotCot** lets investors create custom forms to allow startups to apply for venture capital funding. During the development process I took on the following roles and responsibilties. 
   - Built the form page custom to each investorâ€™s requested fields, including file uploads
   - Used styled-components for UI and Formik to handle input fields, error handling, and validation
   - Worked on a team of five with an agile workflow using Trello, Git flow, and regular stand-ups

### ðŸ“£ How does it work?

1. Design a form containing only the fields you specify. Care about revenue? We got you. Don't care so much about location? Leave that field out
2. Create an account to create a custom Url for your form, and share that Url with your network
3. Check back in frequently to see updates to your form submissions on your own personal feed. You can even filter the results to see exactly what you want.

### ðŸ›  Technologies

- **Heroku**: Hosts the server in the cloud
- **Passport**: Handles social authentication and user persistance
